# Current Research
Pursuing a Doctorate of Science in Cybersecurity focusing on developing a next-gen network intrusion detection system. This research is broken out into the Data, ML, and Evaluation repositories:
* https://github.com/jcapellman/MLIDS-ML
* https://github.com/jcapellman/MLIDS-Data
* https://github.com/jcapellman/MLIDS-Eval

Published dissertation and related works will come as I complete that effort.

There is also some additional research going into other repositories. 

# Open Source Side Work
Like most engineers, I love to code. Creating something from a blank canvas inside an IDE has captivated me since I was 9. Below are a few highlights of this side work I do after hours in my free time. Some repositories are in the early stages of a weekend or evening deep diveâ€”if you are interested in the work or want to take it over, please let me know.

## Cybersecurity Side work
* **Cleanware Generator (CWG)** - File Generation as a service for creating EICAR files (https://github.com/jcapellman/cwg)

## Other Side Work
* **bbxp** - Blogging Platform (https://github.com/jcapellman/bbxp)
