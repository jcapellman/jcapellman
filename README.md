# Open Source Side Work
Like most engineeers - I love to code, creating something from a blank canvas inside an IDE since I was 9 years old has always captivated me. Below are a few highlights of this side work I do after hours in my free time.  Some repositories are at early stages from a weekend or evening deep-dive - if interested in the work or want to take it over please let me know.
