# Open Source Side Work
Like most engineers, I love to code. Creating something from a blank canvas inside an IDE has captivated me since I was 9 years old. Below are a few highlights of this side work I do after hours in my free time. Some repositories are in the early stages of a weekend or evening deep diveâ€”if you are interested in the work or want to take it over, please let me know.
